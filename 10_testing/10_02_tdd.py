'''
Write a script that demonstrates TDD. Using pseudocode, plan out a couple simple functions. They could be
as simple as add and subtract or more complex such as functions that read and write to files.

Instead of writing out the functions, only provide the tests. Think about how the functions might
fail and write tests that will check and prevent failure.

You do not need to implement the actual functions after writing the tests but you may.

# ADD TWO NUMBERS
# get first number
# get second number
# total = first number plus second number
# display total

# CALCULATE TOTAL AFTER DISCOUNT
# get price of item
# get discount rate
# get sales tax rate
# discount amount = price of item times discount rate
# item cost = price of item minus discount amount
# sales tax = item cost times sales tax rate
# final price = price of item plus sales tax
# display final price

# DIVIDE TWO NUMBERS
# get first number
# get second number
# answer = first number divided by second number
# display answer
